#### Education

* **BSc (hons) Computer Games Software Development. (2019 - 2022)**

During my three years studying at Solent University I was able to massivley further my knowledge and confidence using engines such as Unity and Unreal-Engine, also I started working with API's like DirectX 11 and SDL2. During this time period I also started collaborating a lot more with other like minded developers, giving me a lot of valuable experiences.

* **Level 3 Diploma & Extended Diploma in Computer Games Development. (2017 - 2019)**

This two year course focused on all aspects of games development, including simple 2D art and 3D modeling, and the basics of writing clean efficeint code. This course served as my first proper introduction to developing applications professionally, as prior to this I was entirley self taught.
